## Overview

The backend end of my fullstack app. This app uses the [Giphy API](http://api.giphy.com/) through the [Giphy Gem](https://github.com/sebasoga/giphy) to render gifs which users can save and then use to fight against other gifs. Users cn also display their saved gifs and delete them or reuse them in new battles.

I started with designing the database structure and then tried to work out the front end layout from there. I ran into some trouble with how best to translate the DB schema into a functioning front end which forced me to have to rethink the structure of the backend again.

Currently the backend is in a place where I have user owned data and the relations work. I
will need to refactor the layout if I redesign the combat system.

This app is still very much a work in progress. I would still like to implement a dynamic combat system that isnt random. Also I would like to refactor some of the UI and make it a bit more functional and user friendly.
